# Language-Translator
This code is a simple Python program that uses the tkinter, googletrans, and textblob packages to create a graphical user interface for translating text from one language to another.

The program allows the user to select the source and target languages from a list of options, enter the text to be translated, and then displays the translated text in a separate text box.
